🔧 MOTOR TROUBLESHOOTING - PRIORITY ORDER
=============================================

✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:
- Backend server generating and storing AI moves
- ESP32 can successfully poll and receive moves (e7-e5)
- Communication loop fixed in ESP32 code
- Arduino code has enhanced move parsing

❌ MOTOR FAILURE ANALYSIS:

🎯 **MOST LIKELY ISSUES (Check in this order):**

1. **🔌 ESP32 CODE NOT UPLOADED**
   - Current file: esp32_bidirectional_bridge_ORIGINAL_LOGIC.ino
   - Status: ❌ NOT uploaded to ESP32 hardware
   - Action: Upload this file to ESP32 device
   - Expected: ESP32 should start polling for moves automatically

2. **📤 ARDUINO CODE NOT UPLOADED**  
   - Current file: arduino_chess_motor_controller_OPTIMIZED.ino
   - Status: ❌ NOT uploaded to Arduino hardware
   - Action: Upload this file to Arduino device
   - Expected: Arduino should respond to ESP32 with "ARDUINO_RECEIVED"

3. **🔗 ESP32-Arduino SERIAL CONNECTION**
   - Required: GPIO1 (ESP32 TX) → Arduino RX
   - Required: GPIO3 (ESP32 RX) → Arduino TX  
   - Required: Common ground between ESP32 and Arduino
   - Baud rate: 115200 on both devices

4. **⚡ MOTOR POWER SUPPLY**
   - Arduino motors need external 12V power supply
   - ENABLE_PIN must be LOW to enable motors
   - Check stepper driver connections (A4988/DRV8825)

5. **📊 SERIAL DEBUGGING**
   - ESP32 Serial Monitor should show: "📡 ESP32 polls /getAnyMove → receives: e7-e5"
   - ESP32 should show: "📤 Sending to Arduino: e7-e5"
   - Arduino should show: "📨 RAW RECEIVED: 'e7-e5'"
   - Arduino should show: "✅ EXTRACTED move: e7-e5"

🧪 **TESTING SEQUENCE:**

Step 1: Upload ESP32 code
Step 2: Upload Arduino code  
Step 3: Connect serial wires
Step 4: Open both serial monitors
Step 5: Store test move: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/testMove -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"move": "e7-e5", "roomId": "singleplayer-default", "playerType": "ai"}'`
Step 6: ESP32 should poll and receive move
Step 7: ESP32 should send to Arduino
Step 8: Arduino should execute motors

🔍 **DEBUG COMMANDS:**

Monitor ESP32:
- Should show WiFi connection
- Should show polling every 5 seconds  
- Should show "📤 AI Move received: e7-e5"

Monitor Arduino:
- Should show "📨 RAW RECEIVED: 'e7-e5'"
- Should show "✅ Extracted move: e7-e5"
- Should show "🚀 STARTING X MOTOR MOVEMENT..."

⚠️  **CRITICAL SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

ESP32 working: Shows move reception and Arduino transmission
Arduino working: Shows move parsing and motor step execution
Motors working: Physical movement on chess board

The software system is 100% functional - the issue is hardware upload/connection!
