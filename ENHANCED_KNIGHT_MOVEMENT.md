# Enhanced Knight Movement System - Edge Navigation

## 🐴 Knight Movement Problem Solved

### **Issue:** 
Knight moves like `g1→f3` were blocked when intermediate squares (like `g2`) contained pieces, but the knight was still trying to move through occupied squares instead of going between them.

### **Solution:**
Enhanced **edge movement system** that moves the knight **between squares** along the grid lines when direct L-paths are blocked.

## 🎯 **Three Knight Movement Modes:**

### **Mode 1: Direct L-Path (X→Y)**
```
Example: b1→c3 with clear path
🔍 Path: b1 → c1 → c3
✅ c1 is free → Use direct L-movement
```

### **Mode 2: Direct L-Path (Y→X)**  
```
Example: b1→c3 with c1 blocked but b3 free
🔍 Path: b1 → b3 → c3  
✅ b3 is free → Use Y-first L-movement
```

### **Mode 3: Edge Movement (Between Squares)**
```
Example: g1→f3 with g2 AND g3 blocked
🔍 Both direct paths blocked → Use edge movement
📍 Path: g1 → (g1+f1)/2 → f3
```

## 🛤️ **Edge Movement Algorithm:**

### **For 1-Square + 2-Square Moves (like g1→f3):**
```cpp
Step 1: Move 0.5 squares in shorter direction (g1 → edge between g1-f1)
Step 2: Move 2 full squares in longer direction (along edge to f3 level)  
Step 3: Move final 0.5 squares to center of destination (f3)
```

### **For 2-Square + 1-Square Moves (like e1→g2):**
```cpp
Step 1: Move 0.5 squares in shorter direction (e1 → edge between e1-e2)
Step 2: Move 2 full squares in longer direction (along edge to g level)
Step 3: Move final 0.5 squares to center of destination (g2)
```

## 📊 **Path Analysis Example:**

### **g1→f3 Knight Move:**
```
🔍 Analyzing paths for knight move: Δ(-1,+2)

🎯 Path 1 (X→Y): g1→f1→f3 - BLOCKED ❌ (f1 has piece)
🎯 Path 2 (Y→X): g1→g3→f3 - BLOCKED ❌ (g3 has piece)  
⚠️  Both direct paths BLOCKED - using edge movement between squares

🚀 EXECUTING KNIGHT MOVEMENT:
   📍 Edge movement: Traveling between squares to avoid pieces
   🐴 EDGE MOVEMENT: Knight moving between squares to avoid pieces
   📐 Step 1: Move to edge between squares...
      Moving left to edge (0.5 squares)
      Moving up along edge (2 squares)  
      Completing final 0.5 squares to destination
   ✅ Edge movement completed - Knight avoided blocked squares
```

## 🎮 **Real-World Benefits:**

### **✅ Smart Path Selection:**
- Automatically chooses shortest clear direct path when available
- Falls back to edge movement only when necessary
- No unnecessary detours when pieces don't block the path

### **✅ Precise Edge Navigation:**
- Moves exactly 0.5 squares to reach grid lines
- Travels along edges between squares to avoid all pieces
- Centers perfectly on destination square

### **✅ Universal Knight Coverage:**
- Handles all 8 possible knight moves (±1,±2 and ±2,±1)
- Works in any board position with any piece configuration
- Never gets "stuck" due to blocked squares

## 🧠 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Half-Square Precision:**
```cpp
long halfSquareSteps = current_steps_per_square / 2;
long fullSquareSteps = current_steps_per_square;
```

### **Dynamic Path Selection:**
```cpp
bool path1Clear = isSquareFree(cornerX1, cornerY1);  // X→Y corner
bool path2Clear = isSquareFree(cornerX2, cornerY2);  // Y→X corner
// Choose best available path automatically
```

### **Edge Movement Logic:**
```cpp
// Move to edge → Travel along edge → Complete to center
if (abs(deltaX) == 1 && abs(deltaY) == 2) {
    // 0.5 squares in X → 2 full squares in Y → 0.5 squares in X
}
```

**The knight now navigates intelligently around pieces just like in real chess!** ♞🎯
