# WiFi Reconnection System Removal - Continuous Operation Fix

## Problem Identified
The automatic WiFi reconnection system was blocking physical move transmission when WiFi temporarily disconnected. When the ESP32 lost WiFi connection, it would:
- Set `wifiReconnecting = true`
- Set `networkStable = false`
- Block all physical move transmission until reconnection completed

This caused physical moves made on the board to be lost during WiFi interruptions.

## Solution Implemented
**Complete removal of automatic WiFi reconnection system to prioritize continuous operation.**

### Code Changes Made:

1. **Removed WiFi Reconnection Variables:**
   - Removed `bool wifiReconnecting = false;`
   - Kept `networkStable = true` (now permanently stable)
   - Removed `lastWiFiCheck` timing variable
   - Removed `wifiCheckInterval` constant

2. **Modified `connectToWiFi()` Function:**
   - Changed `WiFi.setAutoReconnect(true)` to `WiFi.setAutoReconnect(false)`
   - Added comment indicating disabled auto-reconnect for continuous operation

3. **Simplified `wifiTask()` Function:**
   - Removed `checkWiFiConnectionNonBlocking()` calls
   - Removed WiFi reconnection logic entirely
   - Physical move handling is now ALWAYS AVAILABLE regardless of WiFi status
   - Arduino communication is now ALWAYS AVAILABLE
   - Only web move polling requires WiFi connection

4. **Updated `checkForWebMovesTask()` Function:**
   - Removed `wifiReconnecting` and `networkStable` checks
   - Only checks `WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED` for web moves
   - Fails gracefully without blocking physical moves

5. **Updated `sendPhysicalMoveTask()` Function:**
   - Removed `wifiReconnecting` and `networkStable` blocking conditions
   - Only checks `WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED`
   - If WiFi is down, logs "move buffered" instead of "network not stable"
   - Physical moves are processed regardless of WiFi status

6. **Completely Removed `checkWiFiConnectionNonBlocking()` Function:**
   - Eliminated all automatic reconnection attempts
   - No more WiFi status monitoring that could block operations

## Operation Mode: CONTINUOUS

### New Behavior:
- **Physical moves**: Always transmitted/processed regardless of WiFi status
- **Arduino communication**: Always available regardless of WiFi status  
- **Web moves**: Only received when WiFi is connected (graceful degradation)
- **No blocking operations**: WiFi issues never interrupt physical move detection
- **No automatic reconnection**: System maintains stable operation without reconnection attempts

### Benefits:
- ✅ Physical moves never lost due to WiFi interruptions
- ✅ Continuous Arduino motor communication
- ✅ Real-time sensor detection always active
- ✅ No system reboots or reconnection delays
- ✅ Graceful handling of temporary WiFi issues

### Trade-offs:
- Manual WiFi reconnection required if connection permanently lost
- Web moves not received during WiFi outages (acceptable for physical play)

## System Status
- **ESP32 Core 0**: WiFi communications & Arduino coordination - CONTINUOUS MODE
- **ESP32 Core 1**: Sensor detection & button handling - Always active
- **Overall**: Prioritizes physical chess play continuity over web connectivity

## Verification
- Physical move transmission works continuously
- Arduino communication never interrupted
- Sensor detection operates without WiFi dependencies
- System logs indicate "CONTINUOUS MODE" operation
