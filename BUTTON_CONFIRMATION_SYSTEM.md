# ESP32 Physical Move Confirmation System

## 🔘 **Button Confirmation Feature Added**

### **Purpose:**
Prevents accidental or incomplete moves from being sent to the web interface by requiring manual confirmation via push button.

### **Hardware Setup:**
- **Button Pin:** GPIO 19
- **Connection:** One side to GPIO 19, other side to GND
- **Internal Pull-up:** Enabled (no external resistor needed)
- **Button Logic:** LOW when pressed, HIGH when released

### **How It Works:**

#### **1. Move Detection Process:**
```
1. 🔺 Piece lifted from e7 → LED turns ON
2. 📤 Piece placed on e6 → Move detected: "e7-e6"
3. 🔘 System waits for button press to confirm
4. ✅ Button pressed → Move sent to web
5. 💡 LED double-blink confirmation
```

#### **2. Enhanced Move Flow:**
```cpp
// Before (automatic):
Physical Move → Immediate Web Transfer

// After (with confirmation):
Physical Move → Button Confirmation → Web Transfer
```

### **Visual Feedback:**
- **LED ON:** Piece lifted, waiting for placement
- **LED OFF:** Piece placed, waiting for button confirmation  
- **LED Double Blink:** Move confirmed and sent to web

### **Serial Output Example:**
```
🔺 Piece lifted from e7
📤 Move detected: e7-e6
🔘 Press button to confirm and send to web...

🔘 BUTTON PRESSED! Confirming move...
✅ Sending confirmed move: e7-e6
📤 Sending physical move: e7-e6
✅ Physical move sent successfully!
📤 Move confirmed and sent to web!
```

### **Code Features:**

#### **Button Debouncing:**
- 50ms debounce time prevents multiple triggers
- Reliable button press detection

#### **Move Validation:**
- Only confirmed, complete moves are transmitted
- Prevents partial or accidental moves

#### **Timeout Protection:**
- 10-second timeout cancels unconfirmed moves
- Prevents system from getting stuck

### **Benefits:**

1. **Accuracy:** No more accidental move transmission
2. **Control:** Player decides when move is complete
3. **Reliability:** Debounced button prevents false triggers
4. **Feedback:** Clear LED and serial feedback
5. **Safety:** Timeout prevents system lockup

### **Usage Instructions:**

1. **Make Physical Move:**
   - Pick up piece (LED turns ON)
   - Place piece on destination square
   - See "Move detected" message

2. **Confirm Move:**
   - Press button on GPIO 19
   - Watch for LED double-blink
   - Move is sent to web interface

3. **Cancel Move:**
   - Wait 10 seconds without pressing button
   - Move automatically cancels

This system ensures that only intentional, complete moves are transmitted to the web interface, providing much better accuracy and control over the physical chess board! 🎯♟️
